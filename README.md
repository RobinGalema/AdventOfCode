# AdventOfCode
 This is a repository holding all the code for the Advent of Code challenges from [https://adventofcode.com/2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). For these challenges I used Javascript in a NodeJs environment.
 
 ## Installation
 Clone the repo open the folder in your terminal or code editor and run:
```
 npm install
```

To start run on of the challenges `cd` into the folder and run the corrosponding Javascript file with, for example:
```
node challenge1.js
```
